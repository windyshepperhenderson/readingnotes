**What are four important features to look for in a text editor?**


**What do the following commands do?**

pwd - The first command we are going to learn is pwd which stands for Print Working Directory. (You'll find that a lot of commands in linux are named as an abbreviation of a word or words describing them. This makes it easier to remember them.) The command does just that. It tells you what your current or present working directory is

ls - It's one thing to know where we are. Next we'll want to know what is there. The command for this task is ls. It's short for list.

cd - In order to move around in the system we use a command called cd which stands for change directory

mkdir - The mkdir command in Linux/Unix allows users to create or make new directories. mkdir stands for “make directory.” With mkdir , you can also set permissions, create multiple directories (folders) at once, and much more

touch - The touch command is a standard command used in UNIX/Linux operating system which is used to create, change and modify timestamps of a file

**Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)**

cd projects - 

mkdir new-project - 

touch new-project/newfile.md - 

cd .. - 

ls projects/new-project -
